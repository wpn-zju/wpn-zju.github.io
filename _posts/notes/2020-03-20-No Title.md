今天调试完网站后发现cookies无法正常使用，google了一下发现是因为chrome 80版本开始加强了cookies安全性检查，而且今天chrome刚好开始自动进行80版本更新（设置栏图标会变成更新提示），真的巧。



The big change in Chrome 80, apart from the usual security fixes and improvements, is the enforcement of the new cookie classification system. Google revealed plans in May 2019 to improve cookie controls and protections in the company's browser through the SameSite cookie attribute.



SameSite supports three values of which "lax" is the default in Chrome and the value is automatically set if no other value is set by the site. Lax offers a compromise between security and convenience by blocking cookies from being sent in third-party contexts unless developers set the value to "SameSite=None; Secure" which ensures that third-party cookies will only be sent over HTTPS connections.



还跟HTTPS有关，更巧的是今天刚好准备搞HTTPS的证书，天意啊。
